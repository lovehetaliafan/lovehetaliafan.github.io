<h1>My AI video maker</h1>
<p>l've made a video by a program named 'pictory', where is a place to create your own video by the process of combination. But the whole process is done by <a href="writer.html">AI</a> machine. again, the same characteristic as an <a href="AI.html">AI program</a></p>
<p>you just have to type the script to the blank in a new page. the program will save your work and eventually generate a video for you based on your favor for the video background and the context.  more, you could even add music into it. although the process is complex indeed, but the real video's quality is quite good.</p>
<p>about pictory: pictory.ai is an online video creator, and in here you have many choices to add. you can type a script and choose a style, then the pictory ai could generate a video....or sent an audio to let it have background, insert a well-done file into the generator....now let's see my video!</p>
