<h1>An intro of Daphno from G7.4</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a person called daphne. She is from 7.4, you probably know her. she've been study in BBSZ three years, an old student in here. She also have a younger brother live in grade four in BBSZ. both of us have a great time in here.</p>
<p>because l've study in BBSZ for a long time, so l already know my favorite subjects and subjects l don't like. l like history and geography, because for me it is the pleasure to learn the past and the connection to the reality. l don't really like math and physics(l know they're important!), because they're too abstract so harder to understand (especially math). l also love my art class. However, l should wait it for a long time.</p>
<p>ln the weekend l like stay in home and get online to play or contact. l also enjoy the process of my architecture design project for an international competition. so, you know l'm interest in fine art and designing. l've been learn sketch inthe past, but now l begin to work on abstract project (now l think sketch is too numb). </p>
