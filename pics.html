<h1>An intro to countryhumans</h1>
<p>Country Humans is <strong>an Internet fandom established in humanizing and personating countries, typically portrayed by possessing spherical heads and the human body</strong>. Likewise, it's often accomplished by having national or stereotypical outfits and/or other stylistic choices, such as distinct physical appearances. As hetalia, the countries experienced personification either. but in countryhuamns these countries will not have too much human being characteristics as countries in hetalia. because in this anime these countries represents themselves, but in hetalia these countries also represents a single character, a single person (they also have their own human identity)</p>
<p>How you view these countires depend on our judgement to the personification. When you decide to join the ch fans club, you should have your own oipnion to the history and characters of countries. Remember, countryhuman is a HISTORICIAL fan club. you should always remember it when you enjoy it.</p>
<p>let's take a look now, l hope you like it: </p>
